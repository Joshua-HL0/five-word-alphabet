# five-word-alphabet
C Program to find all combinations of five 5-letter words with no repeating letters given a dictionary file

currently doesn't work because i still need to implement function to get intersect of 2 intersect arrays
came back to this project after about a month so i don't actually remember if it works the way i think it does
guess we'll see when i finalise it!
